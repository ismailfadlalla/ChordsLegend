# üîç React State Debugging - Context Issue

## The Problem

- Firebase is working perfectly ‚úÖ
- AuthProvider is setting state to true ‚úÖ
- But components still see isConnected as false ‚ùå

## Possible Causes

### 1. Multiple AuthProvider Instances

- Check console for multiple "AuthProvider instance created" messages
- Each instance would have different state

### 2. Context Not Updating

- State is set but context doesn't propagate changes
- Component doesn't re-render when state changes

### 3. Hook Implementation Issue

- useAuth hook not properly subscribing to state changes
- Old state values being cached

## Debug Steps

### 1. Check Console Logs

Look for these patterns:

```
AuthProvider instance created: [random-id]
AuthProvider [id]: setIsConnected(true) called
AuthProvider [id]: Timeout state update complete
```

### 2. Use New Debug Buttons

- "Debug Auth Provider" - shows raw context values
- "Refresh Auth State" - shows current hook values

### 3. Check for Multiple Instances

If you see multiple "instance created" messages, there are multiple AuthProviders

## Expected Behavior

After Firebase setup, you should see:

1. `setIsConnected(true) called`
2. `Timeout state update complete`
3. Component should re-render with new state

## If Still Not Working

The issue is definitely in React state management, not Firebase.
Possible solutions:

1. Force component re-render
2. Check App.js for multiple AuthProvider wrapping
3. Verify useAuth hook implementation
