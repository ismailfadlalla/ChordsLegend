# ChordsLegend Pi Network Deployment Status

## Completed Steps

1. ✅ Removed all "v2" and competitor references from code, docs, and URLs.
2. ✅ Created and committed legal documents (`TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md`, `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`, etc.)
3. ✅ Updated SettingsScreen and other UI components for Pi Network.
4. ✅ Created Pi Network integration components (piConfig.ts, piNetworkService.ts).
5. ✅ Added Flask routes to serve legal documents from /legal/ endpoints.
6. ✅ Built the Expo web app for production (`npx expo export:web`).
7. ✅ Created scripts to copy and fix web-build for server deployment.
8. ✅ Modified Flask server to serve both API and React web app.
9. ✅ Fixed path references in web-build files for correct deployment.
10. ✅ Committed and pushed web-build files to GitHub for Railway deployment.
11. ✅ Created automated deployment scripts (deploy.sh and deploy.ps1).
12. ✅ Created test script to verify deployed endpoints (test-railway-deployment.js).

## Verification Steps

1. Wait for Railway to finish deploying (usually 3-5 minutes).
2. Run the test script to verify all endpoints:
   ```
   node test-railway-deployment.js
   ```
3. Verify that the following URLs return HTTP 200 and correct content:

   - https://chordslegend-production.up.railway.app/ (React app)
   - https://chordslegend-production.up.railway.app/api/health (API)
   - https://chordslegend-production.up.railway.app/legal/terms-of-service.html (Legal docs)
   - https://chordslegend-production.up.railway.app/legal/privacy-policy.html (Legal docs)

4. Test in Pi Browser sandbox (https://sandbox.minepi.com/app/chords-legend) to ensure:
   - Full React app loads (not just API responses)
   - Pi SDK integration works
   - Mobile experience is optimized

## Notes

- The app is configured to serve the React web app from the root URL.
- API endpoints are available at /api/\* paths.
- Legal documents are available at /legal/\* paths.
- If any issues occur, check Railway logs and run the test script again.

## Deployment Process

The deployment to Railway has been triggered and is in progress. Railway deployments typically take 3-5 minutes to complete, especially for the first deployment of a full web application.

## Next Steps

1. ⏳ Wait for Railway deployment to complete
2. ✓ Verify all endpoints with test script:
   ```
   node test-railway-deployment.js
   ```
3. Submit the app to Pi Network Developer Program with URLs:

   - App URL: `https://chordslegend-production.up.railway.app/`
   - Terms of Service: `https://chordslegend-production.up.railway.app/legal/terms-of-service.html`
   - Privacy Policy: `https://chordslegend-production.up.railway.app/legal/privacy-policy.html`

4. Test in Pi Browser sandbox (https://sandbox.minepi.com/app/chords-legend)
5. Update the app's Pi Network listing with screenshots
6. Continue enhancing the app with Pi payments and more features

## Future Deployments

For future updates, you can use the automated deployment scripts:

- On Windows: `.\deploy.ps1`
- On macOS/Linux: `./deploy.sh`
