## üêõ How to Debug Authentication Issues

### Step 1: Check Connection Status

2. Look at the top - you should see "Firebase: Connected" in green
3. If red, check your internet connection and Firebase config

### Step 2: Enable Debug Mode

1. In the Auth screen, tap "Show Debug" (development only)
2. This will show real-time logs of what's happening during auth

### Step 3: Test Signup

1. Switch to "Sign Up" mode
2. Enter email: `test@example.com`
3. Enter password: `password123`
4. Watch the debug logs for detailed information
5. Look for success or specific error messages

### Step 4: Test Login

1. Switch to "Login" mode
2. Use the same credentials you just created
3. Watch debug logs for any issues

### Step 5: Use AuthTestScreen

1. From Home screen, tap "Auth Debug" button (if in development)
2. Run automated tests to check Firebase connectivity
3. View detailed test results

## üîç What the Debug Logs Tell You

Look for these key log entries:

- `"Starting login/signup process"` - Authentication attempt started
- `"Connection status: Connected"` - Firebase is reachable
- `"Attempting login/signup for [email]"` - Firebase call initiated
- `"Login/Signup successful"` - Authentication worked
- `"Auth error: [message]"` - Specific error details

## üö® Common Error Messages and Solutions

### "Firebase connection: FAILED"

**Fix:** Check internet connection and Firebase configuration

### "Firebase Auth not initialized"

**Fix:** Verify Firebase config keys in `.env` file

### "auth/invalid-email"

**Fix:** Enter a valid email format (e.g., user@example.com)

### "auth/weak-password"

**Fix:** Use a password with at least 6 characters

### "auth/email-already-in-use"

**Fix:** This email already has an account - try logging in instead

### "auth/user-not-found"

**Fix:** No account exists with this email - try signing up instead

### "auth/wrong-password"

**Fix:** Incorrect password for this email

## üìã Quick Test Checklist

- [ ] Firebase shows "Connected" status
- [ ] Debug mode shows detailed logs
- [ ] Can create new account with unique email
- [ ] Can login with created account
- [ ] Errors are displayed clearly to user
- [ ] Firebase console shows new users being created

## üéØ Next Steps

If you're still having issues after trying these fixes:

1. **Check Firebase Console**: Go to https://console.firebase.google.com and verify:

   - Your project "chords-legend" exists
   - Authentication is enabled
   - Email/Password provider is enabled

2. **Try Different Email**: Use a completely new email address for testing

3. **Clear App Data**: Restart the Expo development server with `npx expo start --clear`

4. **Check Network**: Try different WiFi network or mobile data

5. **Review Debug Logs**: The detailed logs will show you exactly where the process is failing

The enhanced authentication system now provides much better visibility into what's happening, making it easier to identify and fix any remaining issues!
