# üö® Pi Network URL Configuration Fix

## Problem

The Pi Browser is loading the GitHub repository URL instead of the deployed app URL.

## ‚úÖ Current Status

- **Deployed App URL:** https://chordslegend-production.up.railway.app/
- **Deployment Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING (Verified React App serving correctly)
- **Legal Documents:** ‚úÖ ACCESSIBLE

## üîß Solution: Update Pi Network Developer Portal

### Step 1: Access Pi Network Developer Portal

1. Go to: https://develop.pi/
2. Sign in with your Pi Network account
3. Find your "ChordsLegend" app in the dashboard

### Step 2: Update App URL

1. Click on your "ChordsLegend" app
2. Go to "App Settings" or "Configuration"
3. **Change the App URL from:**
   ```
   OLD: https://github.com/ismailfadlalla/ChordsLegend
   ```
   **To:**
   ```
   NEW: https://chordslegend-production.up.railway.app/
   ```

### Step 3: Update Legal Document URLs

Make sure these URLs are correct in the Pi Network portal:

- **Terms of Service:** `https://chordslegend-production.up.railway.app/legal/terms-of-service.html`
- **Privacy Policy:** `https://chordslegend-production.up.railway.app/legal/privacy-policy.html`

### Step 4: Save and Wait

1. Save the changes in the Pi Network portal
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate
3. Try accessing the app again in Pi Browser

## üîç Alternative Testing Method

If you want to test immediately without waiting for Pi Network portal updates:

1. **Direct Test:** Open Pi Browser and manually navigate to:

   ```
   https://chordslegend-production.up.railway.app/
   ```

2. **Sandbox Test:** Try the sandbox URL:
   ```
   https://sandbox.minepi.com/
   ```
   Then search for your app or use the direct URL.

## üìã Verification Checklist

After updating the Pi Network portal:

- [ ] App loads the React interface (not GitHub page)
- [ ] Navigation works within the app
- [ ] Legal documents are accessible
- [ ] Pi SDK integration functions properly
- [ ] Mobile interface is responsive

## üÜò If Still Not Working

1. **Clear Pi Browser Cache**
2. **Check Pi Network Portal for pending approval**
3. **Verify app status in developer dashboard**
4. **Contact Pi Network support if needed**

## üìû Support Information

- **Pi Network Developer Docs:** https://developers.minepi.com/
- **Pi Network Support:** Available through the Pi Network app
- **App Status:** Ready for production use

**Remember:** The issue is in the Pi Network portal configuration, not in our deployed app. The app is working correctly at the Railway URL!
